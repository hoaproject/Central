  <p>Ensuring <strong>software quality</strong> is not easy. The
  <code>Hoa\Test</code> library provides several tools to write and to execute
  tests, to generate test data or tests themselves etc. This is the basis to
  test all Hoa's libraries. Research papers have been published and
  implemented inside <code>Hoa\Test</code> and related libraries (like
  <code>Hoa\Praspel</code>, <code>Hoa\Realdom</code> etc.).</p>

  <h2 id="Introduction" for="main-toc">Introduction</h2>

  <p>Software quality is a vast topic in Computer Science. There are many
  strategies, a lot of metrics… and a lot of confusion. One way to ensure
  quality in Hoa is based on the testing strategy. Let's introduce this
  chapter by some definitions and by presenting the tools provided by the
  <code>Hoa\Test</code> library.</p>

  <h3 id="Nature_of_tests" for="main-toc">Nature of tests</h3>

  <p>Informally, a test is executed on a <strong>System Under Test</strong>,
  abbreviated SUT, and is composed of two parts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Test data</strong> to execute the SUT, and</li>
    <li>An <strong>oracle</strong>, establishing the <strong>test
    verdict</strong>: Are the result of the execution and the state of
    the SUT after its execution the ones we expect or not?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The values of the verdict are: <strong>Success</strong>,
  <strong>fail</strong> or <strong>inconclusive</strong>. “Success” means that
  the result is what we expected, “fail” means that the result was not as
  expected and inconclusive means that it was not possible to determine if the
  result was either a success or failure. The important part is: <q>“what
  <em>we</em> expect”</q>. By extension, we understand a test does not check
  the SUT is <strong>verified</strong>.</p>
  <blockquote cite="Dijkstra">Testing shows the presence, not the absence of
  bugs.</blockquote>
  <p>A test only checks the SUT is <strong>valid</strong>. The difference is
  that a valid system has no bug for some <strong>non exhaustive
  executions</strong>, but a verified system does what it is designed to do.
  Despite this, tests do not prove the absence of bugs, they are useful (easy to
  write, easy to read, not all system can be proven etc.). Nevertheless,
  depending on the chosen test data, tests can be close to proofs. As an
  example, a test with exhaustive test data can be considered as a proof.</p>
  <p>A test can be written <strong>manually</strong>, for instance by a test
  engineer. A SUT is provided, the engineer uses test data to execute it and
  the test verdict is established by the engineer. In the case of an
  <strong>automated</strong> test, the execution of the SUT and the test
  verdict are computed by the machine. This is the role of the “xUnit”
  frameworks, such as <a href="http://atoum.org/">atoum</a> or
  <a href="http://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a>. The engineer will use the frameworks
  to write tests and the machine will execute them. Finally,
  <strong>automatic</strong> tests are generated and executed by the machine.
  The machine may rely on a specification, like a contract, to automatically
  generate the tests (please, see <a href="@hack:chapter=Praspel">the
  <code>Hoa\Praspel</code> library</a> or the research papers below that we have
  published about it to learn more about the Design-by-Contract and
  Contract-based Testing paradigms). Automatic tests have two sub-categories:
  <strong>Online</strong> and <strong>offline</strong> tests. Online means the
  tests are generated and executed in one-pass, while offline means the tests
  are generated and then executed later (with the test data or not).</p>
  <p>In Hoa, we have both <strong>automated</strong> and <strong>offline
  automatic</strong> tests.</p>
  <p>This is a high classification of tests. A thinner one is described by the
  following schema explaining what kind of tests to write:</p>
  <figure>
    <object
      type="image/svg+xml"
      data="https://central.hoa-project.net/Resource/Library/Test/Documentation/Image/Cartography.svg?format=raw&amp;remote=hoa"
      width="100%" style="max-width: 870px"></object>
    <figcaption>Dimensions of the test universe is represented by
    3 axis.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The “Conception support” axis describes the <strong>visibility</strong> we
  have on the System Under Test: Either <strong>black box</strong> or
  <strong>white box</strong>. Their meanings are different according to the
  context but we can consider a system as a white box if we look at and use what
  is <strong>inside</strong> the box, else it is a black box. For instance,
  with unit tests, let's say with a function as the SUT, black box testing will
  consider only the inputs and the outputs of the function without considering
  its body (even if it reads or writes global variables, streams etc.). On the
  other hand, white box testing will consider the body of the function and the
  testing strategy will be totally different.  What we expect from a black box
  or a white box system is not the same.</p>
  <p>The “System size" axis describes at what <strong>level</strong> (or
  altitude) the system will be tested: From the lowest one,
  <strong>unit</strong> (a function or a method) to the highest one, the whole
  <strong>system</strong>, which includes <strong>components</strong> (a set of
  functions) and the <strong>integration</strong> of these components inside
  other ones, which together form the system. All levels are important: While 
  unit tests ensure that a function does what it is supposed to, they do not ensure
  that a function integrates correctly with others in the system.</p>
  <p>Finally, the “Type of test” axis describes the <strong>goal</strong> of the
  tests: Either <strong>functional</strong> (“everything works as expected and
  that's it”), <strong>robustness</strong> (“it is not possible to put the
  system into an error state if we do something unexpected”),
  <strong>performance</strong> (“the system supports heavy loads and behaves
  as expected under these conditions”) etc.</p>
  <p>In Hoa, we have <strong>white box</strong> and <strong>black box</strong>,
  <strong>unit</strong> and <strong>functional</strong> tests. We also include
  performance tests in some libraries.</p>
  <p>Remember that each point in this test universe may imply different tools
  and different development practices. When talking about tests, it is
  important to have this schema in mind and to consider where our problematic
  lies.</p>

  <h3 id="Test_test_case_and_test_suite" for="main_toc">Test, test case and test
  suite</h3>

  <p>Formally, a <strong>test</strong> of a SUT is a set of data (called test
  data) that fixes the values of the arguments (also called inputs) of the
  SUT. A <strong>test case</strong> is a pair composed of a state (the context
  in which the test is executed) and a test. A <strong>test suite</strong> is
  a set of test cases. Therefore, there are two states from the test point of
  view: A <strong>pre-state</strong> —before the execution of the SUT— and a
  <strong>post-state</strong> —after the execution—.</p>
  <p>Building the pre-state is something crucial: The goal is to put the SUT into a
  specific (pre-)state in order to test it. The part of the test case
  responsible for creating the pre-state is called the <strong>preamble</strong>.
  Thus, the preambler is code that puts the SUT into a specific state.</p>
  <p>So, when writing a test case, we will have 3 items to consider:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The <strong>preamble</strong>, to put the SUT into a specific
    state,</li>
    <li>The <strong>execution</strong>, to run the SUT and get a result,</li>
    <li>The <strong>oracle</strong>, to compute the test verdict (based on the
    execution result and the post-state).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The oracle consists of a sequence of assertions: “Is this value equal
  to…?”, “Is this value changed this way…?” etc. It is supposed to be able to
  check the form of some data as much as comparing other data between the
  pre-state and the post-state.</p>
  <p>In a test case, we represent and introduce the preamble, the execution and
  the oracle respectively by the <code>given</code>, <code>when</code> and
  <code>then</code> keywords. This will be detailed hereinafter.</p>

  <h3 id="Test_framework" for="main-toc">Test framework</h3>

  <p>Hoa did not develop its own test framework for several reasons. The main
  one is that this is a laborious task. It implies more development, more tools
  to maintain, less people focused on Hoa etc. Instead, we chose to rely on a
  good project and contribute to it. We chose
  <a href="http://atoum.org/">atoum</a>, <q>“a simple, modern and intuitive test
  framework”</q>.</p>
  <p>Thus, <code>Hoa\Test</code> is the basis used to test all of Hoa's libraries. It
  wraps atoum and it aims at being a bridge between Hoa's features and
  atoum's features. It also adds some features when needed. This is more than
  an abstract layer on top of atoum.  <code>Hoa\Test</code> also provides its
  own command-line to run the tests with everything pre-packaged. Consequently,
  <code>Hoa\Test</code> provides a ready-to-use test environment targeting
  Hoa.</p>
  <p>One shall not be surprised to see some contributors of Hoa as contributors
  of atoum. The two communities are strongly linked. Hoa also provides
  official contributions to atoum like
  <a href="@central_resource:path=Contributions/Atoum/PraspelExtension">the
  <code>atoum/praspel-extension</code> extension</a> and some other
  extensions are based on Hoa, like
  <a href="https://github.com/atoum/ruler-extension">the
  <code>atoum/ruler-extension</code> extension</a> which is based on
  <a href="@hack:chapter=Ruler">the <code>Hoa\Ruler</code> library</a>, also
  used by <code>Hoa\Test</code>. Even some atoum's extensions are tested with
  atoum and Hoa (with <code>atoum/praspel-extension</code>). The loop is
  complete.</p>

  <h2 id="Writing_tests" for="main-toc">Writing tests</h2>

  <p>Each library provides a <code>Test/</code> directory at the root of the
  repository. This is where tests are located. Automated unit tests can be found in
  the <code>Test/Unit/</code> directory while automatically generated unit tests can
  be found in the <code>Test/Praspel/Unit/</code> directory (not by default,
  they must be generated first).</p>

  <h3 id="Automated_unit_tests" for="main-toc">Automated unit tests</h3>

  <p>In Hoa, a test suite is represented by a file, containing a class. A test
  case is a method in this class, expressing the preamble, the execution of
  the SUT and the oracle.  The template of a test suite is then the following
  (let's say for the <code>Test/Unit/Bar.php</code> test suite of the
  <code>Hoa\Foo</code> library):</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">namespace Hoa\Foo\Test\Unit;

use Hoa\Foo\Bar as SUT;
use Hoa\Test;

class Bar extends Test\Unit\Suite
{
    public function case_classic()
    {
        // test case.
    }
}</code></pre>
  <p>We define an alias <code>SUT</code> to the current System Under Test. In a
  unit test context, this is a method or a class. We can also declare the
  <code>CUT</code> alias, standing for Class Under Test, and <code>LUT</code>
  for Library Under Test. <code>LUT</code> is useful if we need to access to
  other classes in the same library. Because they are unit tests, we should not
  use other classes but remember that a test case is composed of a preamble and
  it needs to be build. In this case, <code>LUT</code> could be defined to
  <code>Hoa\Foo</code>.</p>
  <p>The <code>Bar</code> class extends the <code>Hoa\Test\Unit\Suite</code>
  class, which defines a unit test suite. It offers the complete test API needed
  to write tests.</p>
  <p>Test cases are public methods. They do not use a camel case notation but an
  underscore lower-cased notation. They must be prefixed by <code>case_</code>.
  The template of a test case must follow the preamble, execution and oracle
  principle, respectively represented by the <code>given</code>,
  <code>when</code> and <code>then</code> keywords, and thus must be written as
  follows:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">public function case_classic()
{
    $this
        ->given(
            …,
            …,
            …
        )
        ->when(
            …,
            $result = …
        )
        ->then
            ->…;
}</code></pre>
  <p>The <code>given</code> and <code>when</code> “control flow structures” are
  function calls with an unbounded arity. They are void methods, they do
  nothing. The goal is not to pass something to them but to declare variables,
  to establish the preamble and to execute the test. For instance:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">public function case_sum()
{
    $this
        ->given(
            $x = 1,
            $y = 2
        )
        ->when(
            $result = $x + $y
        )
        ->then
            ->integer($result)
                ->isEqualTo(3);
}</code></pre>
  <p>This is strictly equivalent to the following:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">public function case_sum()
{
    // Given:
    $x = 1;
    $y = 2;
    // When:
    $result = $x + $y;
    // Then:
    $this->integer($result)->isEqualTo(3);
}</code></pre>
  <p>We use, however, the first form. It is clearer: Indentation, special
  keywords (through method names) and it forces us to clearly separate these
  3 parts: Preamble, test execution and oracle.</p>
  <p>The <code class="language-php">$result</code> variable is special. It must
  always <strong>hold the result</strong> of the test execution, i.e. the result
  of the SUT's <code class="language-php">return</code> statement. This is a
  <strong>convention</strong>.</p>
  <p>One test case can contain multiple test executions with multiple oracles
    (for instance if a SUT returns different results according to the time).
    Then, the test case must be written as follows:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">public function case_classic()
{
    $this
        ->given(…)
        ->when($result = …)
        ->then
            ->…

        ->when($result = …)
        ->then
            ->…

        ->when($result = …)
        ->then
            ->…;
}</code></pre>
  <p>Assertions are always used after the <code>then</code> part and most of the
  time has the form <code><em>assertion-group</em>-><em>assertion</em></code>.
  We can link assertion groups too. For instance:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">public function case_sum()
{
    $this
        ->given(
            $x = 1,
            $y = 2
        )
        ->when(
            $result = $x + $y
        )
        ->then
            ->integer($result)
                ->isLowerThan(4)
                ->isGreaterThan(2)
            ->string((string) $result)
                ->isNotEmpty();
}</code></pre>
  <p><a href="http://docs.atoum.org/en/latest/asserters.html">The list of all
  assertions</a> can be find on atoum's documentation. Even if it is pretty
  natural to write assertions because it is close to “human conventions”,
  sometimes it is useful to discover that a specific assertion already exists,
  like <code>float->isNearlyEqualTo</code> which compares two floats as
  expected most of the time. So feel free to check atoum's documentation
  often!</p>

  <h4 id="Automatic_test_data_generation" for="main-toc">Automatic test data
  generation</h4>

  <p><code>Hoa\Test</code> includes
  <a href="@central_resource:path=Contributions/Atoum/PraspelExtension">the
  <code>atoum/praspel-extension</code> extension</a>. This extension
  includes <a href="@hack:chapter=Praspel">the <code>Hoa\Praspel</code>
  library</a> and <a href="@hack:chapter=Realdom">the
  <code>Hoa\Realdom</code> library</a> inside atoum. When doing manual or
  automated tests, this extension can be used to <strong>automatically generate
  test data</strong>.</p>
  <p>All we need is to describe a realistic domain (see
  <a href="@hack:chapter=Realdom">the <code>Hoa\Realdom</code> library</a>) with
  the <code>realdom</code> assertion group and then use the <code>sample</code>
  “assertion” (internally this is a <em>handler</em> but the syntax is the same)
  to generate one value or <code>sampleMany</code> to generate many values. For
  instance, to automatically generate an integer in the interval 7 to 13 or 42
  to 153:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">public function case_sum()
{
    $this
        ->given(
            $_x =
                $this
                    ->realdom
                        ->boundinteger(7, 13)
                        ->or
                        ->boundinteger(42, 153),
            $x = $this->sample($_x)
        )
        ->when(…)
        ->then
          ->…;
}</code></pre>
  <p>Actually, <code>atoum/praspel-extension</code> provides 3 asserters to
  generate data and 1 asserter to validate data:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><code>realdom</code> to create a a realistic domain disjunction (see the
    <code>or</code> in the previous example),</li>
    <li><code>sample</code> to generate one datum from a realistic domains
    disjunction,</li>
    <li><code>sampleMany</code> to generate several data,</li>
    <li><code>predicate</code> to validate a datum against a realistic domain
    disjunction.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><code>Hoa\Realdom</code> provides a standard realistic domain collection,
  which includes very useful ones, like <code>regex</code> that describes a
  regular expression (in <a href="http://pcre.org/">the PCRE format</a>).
  Thus, we are able to <strong>automatically generate</strong> a datum against
  or <strong>validate</strong> data <strong>matching regular
  expressions</strong>. The following example generate one string similar to
  an email address:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$this
    ->given(
        $email = $this->sample(
            $this->realdom->regex('/[\w\-_]+(\.[\w\-\_]+)*@\w\.(net|org)/')
        ),
        …
    )
    ->…</code></pre>
  <p>The following example declare a realistic domain representing a date with
  the <code>d/m H:i</code> format, between yesterday and the next Monday:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$this
    ->given(
        $_date = $this->realdom->date(
            'd/m H:i',
            $this->realdom->boundinteger(
                $this->realdom->timestamp('yesterday'),
                $this->realdom->timestamp('next Monday')
            )
        )
    )
    ->…</code></pre>
  <p>Then, to generate one date:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$this->sample($_date)</code></pre>
  <p>Or to sample 42 dates:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$this->sampleMany($_date, 42)</code></pre>
  <p>Similarly, booleans, arrays, classes, colors, strings based on grammars
  etc. can be generated… but also validated! The <code>predicate</code>
  asserter is a real one, contrary to <code>realdom</code>, <code>sample</code>
  and <code>sampleMany</code>. By nature, it computes a boolean: Either
  <code class="language-php">true</code> or
  <code class="language-php">false</code>. It can be used on a realistic domain
  disjunction, for instance:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$this
    ->given(
        $_date = $this->realdom->date(
            'd/m H:i',
            $this->realdom->boundinteger(
                $this->realdom->timestamp('yesterday'),
                $this->realdom->timestamp('next Monday')
            )
        ),
        $stuff = …
    )
    ->when($result = SUT::compute($stuff)
    ->then
        ->predicate($_date, $result);</code></pre>
  <p>In the above example, the <code>_date</code> realistic domain is described,
  not to generate a datum but to validate the result from the SUT.</p>

  <h3 id="Automatically_generated_tests" for="main-toc">Automatically generated
  tests</h3>

  <p>This section has been addressed by a PhD thesis and several
  <a href="#Research_papers">research papers</a>. However, tools are not
  stable yet and documentation is under-writing. Please, refer to
  <a href="@hack:chapter=Praspel">the <code>Hoa\Praspel</code> library</a> to
  get more information.</p>

  <h2 id="Run_tests" for="main-toc">Run tests</h2>

  <p>Most of the time, we will run tests from inside a library repository.
  <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> will be required to install
  dependencies of the library, which includes <code>Hoa\Test</code> as a
  development dependency. Thus, from the root of the library repository:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-shell">$ composer install</code></pre>
  <p>By default it will install development dependencies. If not, force it by
  adding the <code>--dev</code> option.</p>
  <p>A <code>vendor/</code> directory is then created. Inside this directory, we
  will find the <code>bin/hoa</code> command (please, see
  <a href="@hack:chapter=Cli">the <code>Hoa\Cli</code> library</a>). Executing
  this command without any option will list all available sub-commands for this
  current installation. We should see the test commands. To execute tests, we
  will use the <code>test:run</code> sub-command. We must provide the directory
  where tests are stored, which is always <code>Test/</code>. Thus:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-shell">$ vendor/bin/hoa test:run --directories Test/</code></pre>
  <p>Note that the <code>--directories</code> option has a plural form. This is
  because we can specify more than one directory name by using a comma.</p>
  <p>At this point, we will see test executing themselves.</p>

  <h3 id="Interpreting_the_test_result" for="main-toc">Interpreting the test
  result</h3>

  <p>The CLI test reporter will use colours to indicate the <strong>test
  verdict</strong>: green for success, red for fail or inconclusive. In case
  of a success, we should see:</p>
  <pre><code>Success (<em>S</em> test suites, <em>c</em>/<em>C</em> test cases, <em>V</em> void test cases, <em>K</em> skipped test cases, <em>A</em> assertions)!</code></pre>
  <p>where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code><em>S</em></code> is the number of test suites,</li>
    <li><code><em>c</em></code> and <code><em>C</em></code> are the numbers of
    test cases,</li>
    <li><code><em>V</em></code> is the number of inconclusive test cases,</li>
    <li><code><em>K</em></code> is the number of skipped test cases,</li>
    <li><code><em>A</em></code> is the numbre of assertions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In case of a failure, we should see:</p>
  <pre><code>Failure (<em>S</em> test suites, <em>c</em>/<em>C</em> test cases, <em>V</em> void test cases, <em>K</em> skipped test cases, …, <em>F</em> failure, <em>E</em> error, <em>X</em> exception)!
> There is <em>F</em> failure:
…</code></pre>
  <ul>
    <li><code><em>F</em></code> is the number of failed test cases,</li>
    <li><code><em>E</em></code> is the number of unexpected errors,</li>
    <li><code><em>X</em></code> is the number of unexpected exceptions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For each failure description, a “diff” will be computed, i.e. a textual
  differential representation of what we expect and what we got.</p>

  <h3 id="Debugging_mode" for="main-toc">Debugging mode</h3>

  <p>In some cases it is possible that debugging information are accessible but
  hidden for a regular running. To enable the outputs, we need to use the
  <code>--debug</code> option; thus:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-shell">$ vendor/bin/hoa test:run --directories Test/ --debug</code></pre>
  <p>The order of the option does not matter, as usual with the <code>hoa</code>
  command.</p>
  <p>To produce debugging information, we should use the <code>dump</code>
  handler while writing the test case. For instance:</p>
  <pre data-line="12"><code class="language-php">public function case_sum()
{
    $this
        ->given(
            $x = 1,
            $y = 2
        )
        ->when(
            $result = $x + $y
        )
        ->then
            ->dump($result)
            ->integer($result)
                ->isEqualTo(3);
}</code></pre>

  <h3 id="Select_tests_to_run" for="main-toc">Select tests to run</h3>

  <p>Selecting tests to run enables a <strong>faster feedback</strong> and a
  <strong>shorter “test loop”</strong>. We previously used the
  <code>--directories</code> option to pick some directories: Either the test
  root directory <code>Test/</code> or one or many sub-directories (with
  <code>--directories Test/Foo/,Test/Bar/,Test/Baz/Qux/</code> for
  instance).</p>
  <p>We also have the <code>--files</code> option to select one or many
  specific <strong>files to run</strong>. For instance:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-shell">$ vendor/bin/hoa test:run --files Test/Unit/Foo.php,Test/Unit/Bar.php</code></pre>
  <p>Finally, <code>Hoa\Test</code> requires
  <a href="https://github.com/atoum/ruler-extension">the
  <code>atoum/ruler-extension</code> extension</a> to be installed. This
  extension allows to precisely <strong>filter</strong> tests to run. We
  access to it with the <code>--filter</code> option followed by an
  <strong>expression</strong>. Fun fact: Expressions are based on
  <a href="@hack:chapter=Ruler">the <code>Hoa\Ruler</code> library</a>!</p>
  <p>The following variables are available in a filter expression:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>method</code> represents the test case name,</li>
    <li><code>class</code> represents the test suite name,</li>
    <li><code>namespace</code> represents the test suite namespace,</li>
    <li><code>tags</code> represents test suite or test case's tags.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All standard operators from the <code>Hoa\Ruler</code> library can be used.
  So for instance, to only run the <code>Hoa\Foo\Test\Unit\Bar</code> test
  suite, which is represented by a class, we will write:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-shell">$ vendor/bin/hoa test:run --directories Test/ --filter 'class = "Hoa\Foo\Test\Unit\Bar"'</code></pre>
  <p>Or, to run only two specific test cases, let's say
  <code>case_sum</code> and <code>case_baz</code>:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-shell">$ vendor/bin/hoa test:run --directories Test/ --filter 'method = "case_sum" or method = "case_baz"'</code></pre>
  <p>The previous example is strictly equivalent to:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-shell">$ vendor/bin/hoa test:run --directories Test/ --filter 'method in ["case_sum", "case_baz"]'</code></pre>
  <p>Another example to filter by test suites' name: Only the ones that end by
  <code>Qux</code>:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-shell">$ vendor/bin/hoa test:run --directories Test/ --filter 'class matches "Qux$"'</code></pre>
  <p>The <code>matches</code> operator requires a regular expression to
  <a href="http://pcre.org/">the PCRE format</a>.</p>
  <p>Finally, test suites and test cases can hold one or more tags, thanks to the
  <code>@tags</code> annotation. An annotation is a comment of kind <code>/**
  <em>…</em> */</code> located on top of a class, interface, method,
  function etc. Tags allow to have a transversal classification of test cases.
  For instance:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">/**
 * @tags featureA featureB
 */
public function case_sum()
{
    // …
}</code></pre>
  <p>To run only test cases with the tag <code>featureA</code>, we will use the
  following command-line:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-shell">$ vendor/bin/hoa test:run --directories Test/ --filter '"featureA" in tags'</code></pre>
  <p>Here, the variable <code>tags</code> contains an array of strings,
  representing tag names.</p>

  <h3 id="Choose_the_PHP_virtual_machine" for="main-toc">Choose the PHP virtual
  machine</h3>

  <p>When testing, it is also useful to be able to select one specific
  <strong>PHP virtual machine</strong>, like <a href="http://php.net/">a
  specific version of PHP</a> (the default virtual machine) or
  <a href="http://hhvm.com/">the latest version of HHVM</a> for instance. There
  exist several PHP virtual machines nowadays and we cannot ignore them.</p>
  <p>We select a virtual machine by using the
  <code>--php-binary</code> option and by providing a path to the virtual CLI
  binary; thus, for instance:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-shell">$ vendor/bin/hoa test:run --directories … --php-binary /usr/bin/php</code></pre>
  <p>We can imagine that the <code>--php-binary</code> option value is determined by a
  global variable. In this case we could re-use the same script to execute
  tests against several PHP virtual machines, like:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-shell">$ PHP_BIN=/usr/bin/php vendor/bin/hoa test:run --directories … --php-binary $PHP_BIN</code></pre>
  <p>Please, remember to use PHP syntax and features described in
  <a href="https://github.com/php/php-langspec">the PHP specification</a> as
  much as possible.</p>

  <h3 id="Test_execution_engine" for="main-toc">Test execution engine</h3>

  <p>atoum provides several test execution engines, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Inline</strong>, one test case after another in the same
    process,</li>
    <li><strong>Isolate</strong>, one test case after another but each time in a
    new process,</li>
    <li><strong>Concurrent</strong>, “all” test cases at the same time in
    separated processes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When running tests, isolation is really important: No memory conflicts, no
  execution conflicts, the state of the System Under Test is reset each time etc.
  The test verdict does not depend of a previous run and is therefore
  <strong>deterministic</strong> and <strong>unambiguous</strong> (in as far as
  the SUT is).</p>
  <p>By default, <code>Hoa\Test</code> will use the <strong>concurrent</strong>
  test execution engine. All test cases are not executed at the same time; in
  fact the number of test cases to run is defined by the number of processes to
  use. By default, this is either 2 or 4 depending of the platform but we can
  specify it by using the <code>--concurrent-processes</code> option. Thus, to
  force the use of 1024 processes when running the tests (assuming that we have
  a monster computer):</p>
  <pre><code class="language-shell">$ vendor/bin/hoa test:run --directories Test/ --concurrent-processes 1024</code></pre>
  <p>Because the inline test execution engine is not relevant for Hoa's
  usecases and contexts and because the isolate test execution engine has more
  cons than pros compared to the concurrent one (mainly the latter is faster
  than the former), we cannot change the test execution engine. However, to
  emulate the isolate test engine, we could force
  <code>--concurrent-processes</code> to 1.</p>

  <h2 id="Virtual_file_system" for="main-toc">Virtual file system</h2>

  <p>The <code>Hoa\Test</code> library provides a virtual file system over its
  <code>hoa://</code> protocol to ease testing of files or directories.</p>
  <p>The <strong>root</strong> of the virtual file system is
  <code>hoa://Test/Vfs/</code>. Everything added after this root will be a path
  to a <strong>virtual file</strong> or a <strong>directory</strong>.
  Additional <strong>query strings</strong> can be present to specify more
  information, such as permissions, access time etc. The parent-child relation
  is automatically created, it is not necessary to specify that a file is a
  child of a directory, this is deduced from the path.</p>
  <p>Note: The virtual file system is only accessible from inside a test
  case.</p>

  <h3 id="Files_or_directories" for="main-toc">Files or directories</h3>

  <p>A virtual file <code>Foo</code> can be represented by the following path:
  <code>hoa://Test/Vfs/Foo?type=file</code>. In this case, either we open it
  with regular stream functions like
  <a href="http://php.net/fopen"><code>fopen</code></a>,
  <a href="http://php.net/fread"><code>fread</code></a>,
  <a href="http://php.net/fwrite"><code>fwrite</code></a>,
  <a href="http://php.net/file_put_content"><code>file_put_content</code></a>
  etc. or, with <a href="@hack:chapter=File">the <code>Hoa\File</code>
  library</a>, thus:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$file = new Hoa\File\ReadWrite('hoa://Test/Vfs/Foo?type=file');
$file->writeAll('Hello world!');

var_dump($file->readAll());

/**
 * Will output:
 *     string(12) "Hello world!"
 */</code></pre>
  <p>To create a file or a directory, we must use the <code>type</code> query
  string. Using <code>type=file</code> creates a file, while
  <code>type=directory</code> creates a directory; thus:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$directory = new Hoa\File\Directory('hoa://Test/Vfs/Foo?type=directory');</code></pre>
  <p>This is due to the fact that we cannot deduce stream type based on its
  name. This query string is only necessary when creating the file.</p>
  <p>For the rest, it works like any regular files or directories, nothing
  different.</p>

  <h3 id="Permissions" for="main-toc">Permissions</h3>

  <p>To change the permissions, either the specific stream permission functions
  can be used or we can set them directly by using the <code>permissions</code>
  query string followed by an octal value; thus:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$file = new Hoa\File\ReadWrite('hoa://Test/Vfs/Foo?type=file&amp;amp;permissions=0644');
var_dump($file->getReadablePermissions());

/**
 * Will output:
 *     string(10) "-rw-r--r--"
 */</code></pre>
  <p>As any query strings, we can concatenate key-values by using the
  <code>&amp;amp;</code> symbol. For instance,
  <code>type=directory&amp;amp;permissions=0644</code> represents a directory
  with the <code>0644</code> permissions.</p>

  <h3 id="Access_change_and_modify_time" for="main-toc">Access-, change- and
  modify-time</h3>

  <p>This can also be useful to define access-, change- and modify-time by
  respectively using the <code>atime</code>, <code>ctime</code> and
  <code>mtime</code> query strings. The expected values are an integer
  representing a timestamp (a number of seconds). Thus, to represent a file
  that has been accessed in the future (in 1 minute):</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$aTime = time() + 60;
$file  = new Hoa\File\ReadWrite('hoa://Test/Vfs/Foo?type=file&amp;amp;atime=' . $aTime);</code></pre>

  <h2 id="Conclusion" for="main-toc">Conclusion</h2>

  <p>The <code>Hoa\Test</code> library is a set of tools to make <strong>white
  box</strong> or <strong>black box</strong>, <strong>unit</strong> or
  <strong>functional</strong>, <strong>automated</strong> and
  <strong>automatic unit</strong> tests. It is more than a wrapper around
  <a href="http://atoum.org/">atoum</a>: It provides a test structure and
  conventions, a <strong>virtual file system</strong> and
  <strong>extensions</strong> to <strong>automatically generate</strong> test
  data, automatically generate tests or to get a powerful test
  <strong>filtering</strong> system. Grammar-based Testing, Solver-based
  Testing, Random-based Testing, Contract-based Testing… all these paradigms
  live in <code>Hoa\Test</code>. Several <a href="#Research_papers">research
  papers have been published</a> in major test literature and conferences.</p>
