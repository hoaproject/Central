![Hoa](http://static.hoa-project.net/Image/Hoa_small.png)

Hoa is a **modular**, **extensible** and **structured** set of PHP libraries.
Moreover, Hoa aims at being a bridge between industrial and research worlds.

# Central

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/hoaproject/Central](https://badges.gitter.im/hoaproject/Central.svg)](https://gitter.im/hoaproject/Central?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

The central repository contains all Hoa's libraries. It is a read-only
repository.

## Request For Comments

Many changes, including bug fixes or documentation improvements can be
implemented via our classical workflow (see the
[Contributor Guide](https://hoa-project.net/Literature/Contributor/Guide.html)). However,
some changes are more important, and can potentially impact the whole
design of several libraries. In this particular case, we need to
produce a consensus among the Hoa community.

The Request For Comments (RFC) process aims at providing a consistent
path for new features to enter libraries, so that all stakeholders can
be confident about the direction the language is evolving in.

All RFC are hosted on the
[the Github mirror](https://github.com/hoaproject/Central) under
the form of issues. A special label
[`request for comment`](https://github.com/hoaproject/Central/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22request+for+comment%22)
indicates them.

There is no hard and strict process yet. If you would like to create
an RFC, come on IRC or “copy” an existing ones. The main design is:
Introduction, goals, details, impact, and outro.

## Roadmap

A roadmap is mostly a set of RFC. Each roadmap takes the form of a
milestone on Github.

Existing milestone:

  * [Roadmap for 2017](https://github.com/hoaproject/Central/milestone/1).
